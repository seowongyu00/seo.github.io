I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering and during my university years, I conducted research related to ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge) at the [Data Science lab of the GIST AI Graduate School](https://sundong.kim). Currently, I am working in the field of credit risk consulting at [KoDATA](http://www.kodata.co.kr), where I leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess and manage financial risk.

My work involves analyzing complex financial data to predict credit risk, providing actionable insights to help businesses make informed decisions. With a solid foundation in data-driven methodologies, I aim to contribute to innovative solutions in the financial sector, specifically in managing risk and improving credit evaluation processes.

Thank you.
