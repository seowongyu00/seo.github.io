I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and during my university years, I conducted research related to ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge) at the [Data Science lab of the GIST AI Graduate School](https://sundong.kim). Currently, I am working in the field of credit risk consulting at [KoDATA](http://www.kodata.co.kr), where I leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess and manage financial risk.

My role involves analyzing complex financial datasets to design robust credit rating models and early warning systems that help businesses mitigate risk and make informed, data-driven decisions. By utilizing both predictive and explanatory models, I ensure that the insights derived from the data are not only accurate but also easily interpretable and actionable. This approach enables businesses to understand the reasoning behind the models, fostering confidence in the decision-making process. With a deep understanding of data-driven methodologies, I am committed to enhancing financial risk management through innovative and transparent solutions that support better decision-making in the evolving credit industry.

Thank you.
