### Projects

## Credit Rating Modeling and Early Warning Systems at IBK
At IBK (Industrial Bank of Korea), I developed credit rating models and early warning systems using Explainable AI (XAI) methodologies. These models provide transparent and interpretable insights, helping businesses mitigate financial risks by understanding the underlying factors influencing credit decisions. Through this project, I ensured that decision-makers could trust the predictive outcomes, fostering better data-driven strategies for financial risk management.
